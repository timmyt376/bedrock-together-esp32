ESP32 BedrockTogether Pro

ESP32 BedrockTogether Pro is a standalone ESP32-based LAN broadcast bridge for Minecraft Bedrock Edition, designed to make joining custom servers on consoles effortless — no DNS tricks, no phone apps, no PC required.

Inspired by BedrockTogether, this project allows an ESP32 device to broadcast multiple custom Bedrock servers as LAN games, making them instantly visible to Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch players.

The device hosts a built-in web interface for server management, displays real-time status on a 1.5” SSD1351 colour OLED, and includes a secure remote admin terminal for advanced control.
